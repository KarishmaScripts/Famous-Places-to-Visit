    <h2>Cliffs of Moher, Ireland</h2>
    <p>
        The Cliffs of Moher are one of Ireland’s most iconic and stunning natural landmarks, attracting visitors from around the world to experience their breathtaking beauty. Located on the Atlantic coast in County Clare, these dramatic cliffs offer spectacular views and have become a symbol of Ireland’s rugged coastline.<br><br>
        The name "Moher" is derived from a fortress called Moher that once stood on the cliffs, near the present-day O'Brien's Tower. The tower was built in the 19th century by Sir Cornelius O'Brien, a local landowner, to offer visitors a better view of the surrounding area.<br>
        The cliffs have been known since ancient times and were part of the traditional route for pilgrims and travelers. They were used as a defensive point during various historical periods, especially during the Norman invasions.
        <br><br>
        The Cliffs of Moher are a major tourist attraction in Ireland, drawing over a million visitors annually. The site is equipped with amenities to enhance the visitor experience while preserving the natural beauty of the cliffs.
